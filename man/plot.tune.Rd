\description{
Function to plot performance criteria, such as classification error rate or
correlation of cross-validated components for different models.

Function to plot performance criteria, such as classification error rate or
balanced error rate on a tune.splsda result.
}
\details{
\code{plot.tune.splsda} plots the classification error rate or the balanced
error rate from x$error.rate, for each component of the model. A lozenge
highlights the optimal number of variables on each component.

\code{plot.tune.block.splsda} plots the classification error rate or the
balanced error rate from x$error.rate, for each component of the model. The
error rate is ordered by increasing value, the yaxis shows the optimal
combination of keepX at the top (e.g. `keepX on block 1'_`keepX on block
2'_`keepX on block 3')

\code{plot.tune.spls} plots either the correlation of cross-validated
components or the Residual Sum of Square (RSS) values for these components
against those from the full model for both \code{t} (X components) and
\code{u} (Y components). The optimal number of features chosen are indicated
by squares.

If neither of the \code{object$test.keepX} or \code{object$test.keepY} are
fixed, a dot plot is produced where a larger size indicates the strength of
the measure (higher correlation or lower RSS). Otherwise, the measures are
plotted against the number of features selected. In both cases, the colour
shows the dispersion of the values across repeated cross validations.

\code{plot.tune.spca} plots the correlation of cross-validated components from
the \code{tune.spca} function with respect to the full model.

\code{plot.tune.splsda} plots the classification error rate or the balanced
error rate from x$error.rate, for each component of the model. A lozenge
highlights the optimal number of variables on each component.

\code{plot.tune.block.splsda} plots the classification error rate or the
balanced error rate from x$error.rate, for each component of the model. The
error rate is ordered by increasing value, the yaxis shows the optimal
combination of keepX at the top (e.g. `keepX on block 1'_`keepX on block
2'_`keepX on block 3')
